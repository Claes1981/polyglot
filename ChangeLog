=========1.4.33b================
- New option: "WbWorkArounds". Currently it blocks options which contain "Draw" in their name from being sent to the GUI. Engines that have such options are Rybka and HIARCS. 
- Bugfix for ASSERT failure in bright. Now another ASSERT failure has appeared which seems to be bright's fault however. 
=========1.4.32b================
- Bugfix: the default setting for RepeatPV had become false again...
=========1.4.31b================
- Bugfix: improper handling of vararg function.
=========1.4.30b================
- Some more meaningful error messages added.
- Some buffer overflow checks added.
- Simplification of strange signal kludge in gui.c. 
- Removal of obsolete code in engine.c and gui.c. Platform specific code has been abstracted and pushed into pipex_win32.c and pipex_posix.c
- The format of the version number has changed once again. Debian was unhappy with the previous one.
=========1.4b29================
- Conversion from C++ to C (suggested by E.M.)
- More refactoring. The win32 and posix I/O now have a uniform interface (see pipex.h). 
=========1.4b28================
- Some comments added to explain the exact behaviour of some of the public functions in pipe.cpp. 
- LineInput now returns a bool which is FALSE in case of EOF. 
=========1.4b27================
- Option "ScoreWhite" : report score from white's point of view (suggested by E.M.).
- Option "KibitzInterval" : try to wait this many seconds between kibitzes (suggested by E.M.)
=========1.4b26================
- Contraction of version number.
- Log if SetProcessAffinityMask is not available (suggested by E.M.).
- pipe.cpp : Make PipeStruct a proper class with private/public members.
- Check for EOF in GUI input.
- pipe.cpp : delay reporting EOF until buffer is empty.
- Messages from the Engine to PG were not logged in the windows version.
=========1.4w10UCIb24===========
- Portability fixes for WIN9X (Eric Mullins).
- Portability fixes for MSVC++ (Eric Mullins).
- Default setting of RepeatPV is now true.
- Do not read data if input buffer is full (Windows).
=========1.4w10UCIb22===========
- Polyglot now completely poll free...
=========1.4w10UCIb21===========
- Crash bug in memory command fixed
- Small optimizations
=========1.4w10UCIb20===========
- More refactoring.
- No more polling for GUI input
=========1.4w10UCIb18===========
- Two new utilities: info-book and dump-book.
=========1.4w10UCIb17===========
- More refactoring. main.cpp is now #ifdef _WIN32 free.
- The main loop (previously in adapter.cpp) is now in its own file mainloop.cpp.
- adapter.cpp has been renamed into xboard2uci.cpp. It is #ifdef _WIN32 free.
- EOF from the engine no longer kills PG. It should now
be possible to close an engine and reopen another one (if that ever became useful) 
=========1.4w10UCIb16===========
- xboard options commands
- correction of handling of combo boxes in UCI protocol
- "gui-mode". It is now possible to run PG without config file
- The polyglot options are not exported, so they are now settable by the GUI
=========1.4w10UCIb15===========
- Due to refactoring time stamps in Windows would be written twice. 
This has been fixed. 
- More refactoring; the number of #ifdef _WIN32's has again been
drastically reduced.
=========1.4w10UCIb14===========
- option to alter priority now also works on windows
(Eric Mullins)
- refactoring so that posix and win32 part share more
code
- a number of potential busy loop scenarios have been eliminated 
in the Windows code (Windows uses polling)
- the return value of CreateProcess is now checked
=========1.4w10UCIb13===========
- perft mode exposed.
=========1.4w10UCIb12===========
- Replaced %lld everywhere by S64_FORMAT.
=========1.4w10UCIb11===========
- Crash bug fix (wrong parentheses in instruction that checked for help
option).
=========1.4w10UCIb10===========
- It is now possible to do "make rpm" to make an rpm binary package. 
- Trivial bug fixes.
- Documentation added for epd-test functionality (man page).
- Cosmetic cleanups of output of epd-test.
- "polyglot --help" output added.
- Added polyglot book format specification to distribution.
=========1.4w10UCIb9===========
- Trivial cosmetic fixes
- Some engines do not support the "Hash" options.
So we do not send memory=1 in that case. 
=========1.4w10UCIb8===========
- Support for egtpath command in xboard protocol
=========1.4w10UCIb7===========
- Debianization: it is now possible to do "make deb" to build a Debian/Ubuntu
package.
=========1.4w10UCIb6===========
- UCI GUI support added. This makes it possible to use PG as a book engine
on GUI's like ChessBase and Arena which normally only support their
own proprietary format. 

- Support for new xboard "cores N" and "memory N" commands. See here
for a complete description

	http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/engine-intf.html

- Some work arounds for engines like Toga which only allow some settings
to be set before the first "isready" command. 

- Autotooled distribution.

- Proper manual page. The README file is generated automatically from this. 

- More sane naming of README files.

- If BookLearn is false (the default) PG will open the book read only.

- Windows and non-Windows log file formats are now the same.

- Proper ChangeLog (you are reading it!).
=========1.4w10================
fixed analysis output for toga
=========1.4w9=================
fixed bug in 1.4w8
added RepeatPV workaround
	fixed disappearing output in engine-output window while in multipv mode
	when an engine sends its move to polyglot,
	polyglot normally repeats the last pv string(which also contains score,depth and time usage) it got from the engine.
	Some engines however do not send a new pv string just before sending the move and the now old pv string
	find might confuse debugtools that parse the winboard debug files.
	Adding "RepeatPV = false" to the [POLYGLOT] section of the ini file stops this repetition.
 
=========1.4w8=================
fixed multipv output
note that the pv with the worst score will be on top of the engine-output window.
added timestamp in logfile (Jaap Weidemann)

=========1.4w7=================
compiles under linux/unix again
=========1.4w6=================
access to winboard draw/drawoffer and resign

	1:to activate draw offers the engine has 
	   to define the "UCI_DrawOffers" parameter with the 'option" command at startup. 
	2:to offer a draw or accept a draw offer:just send "info string DrawOffer" to polyglot. 
	3:if winboard sends "draw" polyglot sends "setoption DrawOffer draw" to the engine.
	4.to resign: send "info string Resign" to polyglot.
	please check the winboard documentation for the draw/drawoffer and resign commands.
		
=========1.4w5:================
Fixed errors in SyncStop handling.
book building: the error message now also contains the game number 
added Affinity option:
In the [PolyGlot] section(ini file):
- "Affinity" mask
mask is a bit vector in which each bit represents the processors that a process is allowed to run on.

some minor bugs fixed

checks if child did really quit.
