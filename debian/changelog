polyglot (1.4.39b) unstable; urgency=low
	
  * Refactoring of config file parsing

  * Fix crash bug in epd-test
	
  * Do not export Chess960. This is handled completely internally. 
	
  * Do not export UCI_Opponent and UCI_Chess960. These are handled internally.

polyglot (1.4.37b) unstable; urgency=low

polyglot (1.4.36b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: option = 0/1 was translated incorrectly.

  * Bugfix: Nasty buffer overflow in the macro CONSTRUCT_ARG_STRING.

  * Bugfix: pipex_writeln (win32) was logging at the wrong spot. 

  * Log board when an illegal move is received.

polyglot (1.4.35b) unstable; urgency=low

  * New WbWorkAround for silly bug in WB. Depth <=1 clears the engine output window. Why shouldn't an engine be allowed to send info at depth one?	

 -- Michel Van den Bergh <michel.vandenbergh@uhasselt.be>  Thu, 7 Aug 2009 20:00:00 +0100

polyglot (1.4.34b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Trying to set a non existent UCI option gives an error. 
	
  * PG will now resign in case of an illegal engine move. 
	
  * More code has been moved into the I/O abstraction layer pipex. This has reduced to win32 dependence of utils.c
	
  * info strings and unrecognized info lines are relayed to the GUI.

polyglot (1.4.33b) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option: "WbWorkArounds". Currently it blocks options which contain "Draw" in their name from being sent to the GUI. Engines that have such options are Rybka and HIARCS. 
	
  * Bugfix for ASSERT failure in bright. Now another ASSERT failure has appeared which seems to be bright's fault however.

  * The format of the version number has changed once again. Debian was unhappy with the previous one.

polyglot (1.4b27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Option "ScoreWhite" : report score from white's point of view (suggested by E.M.).
	
  * Option "KibitzInterval" : try to wait this many seconds between kibitzes (suggested by E.M.).

  * Check for EOF in GUI input.
	
  * pipe.cpp : delay reporting EOF until buffer is empty.
	
  * Messages from the Engine to PG were not logged in the windows version.
